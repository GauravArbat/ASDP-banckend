# Render Deployment Guide for ASDP Backend

## Overview
This guide explains how to deploy the ASDP backend on Render's free tier.

## Important Notes for Free Tier
- **No Persistent Storage**: Data will be lost on each deployment
- **Ephemeral Storage**: Uploads and database are temporary
- **Auto-restart**: Service restarts after 15 minutes of inactivity

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Push Code to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Configure for Render deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy on Render
1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/)
2. Click "New +" â†’ "Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub repository: `GauravArbat/ASDP-banckend`
4. Render will auto-detect the `render.yaml` configuration
5. Click "Create Web Service"

### 3. Environment Variables
The following environment variables are automatically set:
- `SECRET_KEY`: Auto-generated by Render
- `UPLOAD_FOLDER`: Set to `uploads` (ephemeral)
- `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`: Set to `sqlite:///app.db` (ephemeral)
- `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`: Set to 16MB

### 4. First Run Setup
After deployment:
1. Access your service URL
2. The first admin user will be created automatically
3. Default credentials: `admin` / `admin123`
4. **Important**: Change the password immediately after first login

## Limitations of Free Tier

### Data Persistence
- **Database**: SQLite database is ephemeral (resets on restart)
- **Uploads**: Files are lost when service restarts
- **User Accounts**: Need to be recreated after each restart

### Workarounds
1. **For Development/Testing**: Free tier is perfect
2. **For Production**: Consider upgrading to paid plan for persistent storage
3. **Data Backup**: Implement external backup solutions

## Monitoring
- Check Render dashboard for service status
- View logs in real-time
- Monitor resource usage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Build Failures**: Check requirements.txt compatibility
2. **Runtime Errors**: Check application logs
3. **Port Issues**: Render automatically handles PORT environment variable

### Health Check
- Service health is monitored at `/` endpoint
- Ensure your app responds to root path

## Upgrade to Paid Plan
To enable persistent storage:
1. Upgrade to Starter plan ($7/month)
2. Add disk configuration back to `render.yaml`
3. Update environment variables to use `/data` paths
